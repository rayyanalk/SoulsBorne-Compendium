# SoulsBorne-Compendium
Project files for CRUD functional Dark Souls/Bloodborne boss compendium

The SoulsBorne Boss Compendium permits users to inspect the narrative and statsitical information of a collection of bosses from the Dark Souls series and Bloodborne. Database interaction allows for the seamless modification of any and all numerical information associated with each boss, and further, users can challenge a boss to a simulated battle with a character and gear set of their design to see if they have what it takes to defeat these monsters.
